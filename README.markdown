# SDAZ
A Java Speed-Dependent Automatic Zooming Library

SDAZ implements a navigation technique invented by Takeo Igarashi and Ken Hinckley for browsing 2D documents that integrates rate-based scrolling with automatic zooming. The viewport automatically zooms out when the user scrolls rapidly so that the perceptual scrolling speed in screen space remains constant. As a result, the user can efficiently and smoothly navigate through a large document without becoming disoriented by extremely fast visual flow.
